\subsection{Organization}

In what follows, we investigate how to formulate the persistent Betti number (PBN) computation on filtered simplicial complexes in parameterized settings. 
In particular, in section~\ref{sec:betti_derivation}, we show how the PBN may be expressed as a sum of rank computations on unfactored boundary (sub)matrices. 
By representing the boundary operators implicitly and exploiting a variety of properties of the rank function, we demonstrate the rank-based PBN expression admits certain computational advantages in both static and parameterized settings. 
We show the $p$-th PBN of a filtered simplicial complex $K_\bullet$ may be computed in essentially quadratic time and linear storage, as opposed to the cubic time and quadratic storage complexity required by persistence.
Finally, we illustrate both the computational and practical advantages our expression has with a few applications in section~\ref{sec:applications}. 
%By exploiting a connection between the rank function and the spectrum of linear operators, we also introduce a spectral-based approach $(1-\epsilon)$-approximates the PBN. 

%We show that taking relaxation is permutation invariant, obeys certain inclusion-exclusion principles, and admits a notion of stability---all properties useful in parameterized settings. 
%We illustrate a few applications of the relaxation in section. 
%Moreover, we show our relaxation is \emph{interpetretable} as it satisfies certain basic ``Betti-like'' properties and we illicit its connections back to spectral graph theory.

\section{Motivating Derivation}\label{sec:betti_derivation}
%In what follows, we briefly outline the computation of the 

% For the moment, we omit the subscript $t \in \mathrm{T}$ and focus on a fixed instance of time. 
Let $B_p(K_\bullet) \subseteq Z_p(K_\bullet) \subseteq C_p(K_\bullet)$ denote the $p$-th boundary, cycle, and chain groups of a given filtration $K_\bullet$, respectively. 
Additionally, let $\partial_p : C_p( K_{\bullet}) \to C_p(K_{\bullet})$ denote the boundary operator sending $p$-chains to their respective boundaries. 
With a slight abuse of notation, we also use $\partial_p$ to also denote the filtration boundary matrix with respect to an ordered basis $(\sigma_i)_{1 \leq i \leq m_p}$.  
The $p$-th persistent Betti number $\beta_p^{i,j}$ at some index $(i,j) \in \Delta_+^m$ is defined as: 
\begin{align*} \label{eq:pbn}
	\beta_p^{i,j} &= \mathrm{dim}(H_p^{i,j}) \\
	&= \mathrm{dim} \left( Z_p(K_i) / (Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \right) \\
	& \numberthis = \mathrm{dim} \left( Z_p(K_i) \right) - \mathrm{dim}\left( Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \right ) 
\end{align*}
%The dimension of the boundary group $B_{p-1}(K_i)$ may be directly inferred from the rank of $\partial_p^{i}$, and the dimension of $C_p(K_i)$ is simply the number of $p$-simplices with filtration values $f(\sigma) \leq i$. 
While $Z_p(K_i) = \mathrm{nullity}(\partial_p(K_i))$ and is thus may be reduced to a rank computation, the intersection term (the persistence part) is more subtle. Zomorodian et al~\cite{zomorodian2004computing} give a procedure to compute a basis for $Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j)$ via a sequence of boundary matrix reductions; the subsequent Theorem (5.1) reduces the complexity of computing PH groups with coefficients in any PID to that of computing homology groups. However, the standard homology computations require $O(m^2)$ space and $O(m^3)$ time to compute, implying the PBN computation has the same complexity as the full persistence computation.

%Alternatively, both iterative and explicit projector-based methods~\cite{ben2015projectors} may also for the intersection term in~\eqref{eq:pbn}, though these projectors may still be expensive to compute. 
% TODO: elaborate more, give von neumann inequality 

In what follows, we outline a different approach to computing~\eqref{eq:pbn} that is both simpler and computationally more attractive. 
To illustrate our approach, we require more notation. If $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix, let $A^{i, j}$ denote the lower-left submatrix defined by last $m - i + 1$ rows (rows $i$ through $m$, inclusive) and the first $j$ columns. 
%Given an $n \times m$ matrix $A$, let $A[I, J]$ refer to the submatrix formed by taking rows in the set $I$ and taking columns in the set $J \subseteq [m]$. Let $L_{, j}$
%\begin{equation}
%	\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
%       & i        & j \\
%i      & A & A_{ii}  \\
%m\text{ - }i & A_{\overline{i}i} & A_{jj}
%\end{bNiceMatrix}
%\end{equation}
\begin{figure}

	\caption{(Left) the persistent Betti number $\beta_p^{i,j}$ counts the number of points (3) in upper left-corner of $\mathrm{dgm}_p(K_\bullet)$. (Middle) The additivity of PBNs can be used to express multiplicity $\mu_p^{i,j}$ of any given box. (Right) The computational interpretation of the Pairing Uniqueness Lemma; in this case $r_R(i,j) = 3 - 2 + 1 - 2 = 0$ yields whether the entry $R[i,j]$ is non-zero.}
	\label{fig:mult}
\end{figure}
For any $1 \leq i < j \leq m$, define the quantity $r_A(i,j)$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
	r_A(i,j) = \mathrm{rank}(A^{i,j}) - \mathrm{rank}(A^{i\texttt{+}1,j}) + \mathrm{rank}(A^{i\texttt{+}1,j\text{-}1}) - \mathrm{rank}(A^{i,j\text{-}1})
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%	r_A(i,j) = \mathrm{rank}(A^{i, j}) - \mathrm{rank}(A^{i+1, j}) + \mathrm{rank}(A^{i+1, j-1}) - \mathrm{rank}(A^{i, j-1})
%\end{equation}
The structure theorem from~\cite{zomorodian2004computing} shows that 1-parameter persistence modules can be decomposed in an \emph{essentially unique} way into indecomposables. Computationally, a consequence of this phenomenon is the Pairing Uniqueness Lemma~\cite{cohen2006vines}, which asserts that if $R = \partial V$ is the decomposition of the boundary matrix, then:  
$$ r_R(i,j) \neq 0 \Leftrightarrow R[i,j] \neq 0 $$
Since the persistence diagram is derived completely from $R$, this result suggests that information about a diagram can be obtained through rank computations alone.
For a more geometric description of this idea, see the third picture in Figure~\ref{fig:mult}. We record a non-trivial fact that follows from this observation: 
\begin{lemma}[Dey \& Wang~\cite{dey2022computational}]\label{lemma:rank}
Let $R = \partial V$ denote the matrix decomposition of a given filtered boundary matrix $\partial$ derived from the associated filtration $K_\bullet$. For any pair $(i,j)$ satisfying $1 \leq i < j \leq m$, we have:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:lower_left_rank}
		\mathrm{rank}(R^{i,j}) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial^{i, j})
	\end{equation}
Equivalently, all lower-left submatrices of $\partial$ have the same rank as their corresponding submatrices in $R$. 
\end{lemma}
\noindent Lemma~\ref{lemma:rank} was the essential motivating step used by Chen et al~\cite{chen2011output} in their rank-based persistence algorithm---the first output-sensitive algorithm given for computing persistent homology of a filtered complex. 
In fact, Lemma~\ref{lemma:rank} may be further generalized to arbitrary rectangles in $\Delta_+$ via $\mu$\emph{-queries}~\cite{chen2011output}: box-parameterized rank-based queries that count the number of persistence pairs that intersect a fixed ``box'' placed in the upper half-plane. 
Our first result of this effort we show is that this Lemma allows us to write the persistent Betti number as a sum of rank functions. 
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:rank_reduction}
For any fixed $p \geq 0$, let $\partial_p$ denote the $p$-dimensional boundary matrices of filtration $K_\bullet$ of size $n = \lvert K^{(p)} \rvert$, $m = \lvert K^{(p\+1)} \rvert$. For any pair $(i,j) \in \left([n], [m] \right)$, the persistent Betti number $\beta_p^{i,j}$ at $(i,j)$ is given by:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:betti_four}
	\beta_p^{i,j} = \mathrm{rank}(I_p^{1,i}) - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^{1,i}) - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p\+1 }^{1,j}) + \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p\+1}^{i \+ 1, j} )
	%\mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p+1}^{i+1,\ast} \otimes\partial_{p+1}^{\ast,j} )
	\end{equation}
where $I_p^{1,i}$ denotes the first $i$ columns of the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
\end{proposition}
\noindent A detailed proof using Lemma 1 is given in the appendix. The primary utility proposition~\eqref{prop:rank_reduction} provides is it expresses the PBN of a filtration $K_\bullet$ as a combination of rank computations performed directly on the \emph{unfactored} dimension $p$ and $(p+1)$ boundary matrices. We dedicate the rest of the paper to exploring the consequences of this fact. 

To get some intuition on what the structure and size of these matrices, we include a picture of each of the terms in Equation~\eqref{eq:betti_four}. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{four_matrices}
	\caption{The four matrices whose ranks yield $\beta_p^{i,j}$ in the same order as given in~\eqref{eq:betti_four}. Each solid portion represents (sparse) blocks of non-zero entries, while each white portion is zero. Observe $\partial_{p+1}^{i+1, j} \subseteq \partial_{p+1}^{1,j}$ can be obtained by intersecting the non-zero entries of $\partial_{p+1}^{1,j}$ with the non-zero entries in the complement of $\partial_p^{1,i}$.  }
\end{figure}
Boundary matrices are sparse and highly structured: given $K_\bullet$ with $m$ simplices $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots, \sigma_m$ constructed from a $p$-dimensional complex $K$, its full boundary matrix $\partial$ is upper-triangular and has a storage complexity of: 
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{nnz}(\partial) \sim O(m \log m)
\end{equation} 
To see this, note that since a $p$-simplex has $2^{p+1} - 1$ faces, $p \leq \log(m + 1) - 1$. Moreover, since each column of $\partial_p^\ast$ contains exactly $p+1$ non-zero entries, $\mathrm{nnz}(\partial) \sim O((p+1)m)$. Indeed, the relation $\partial_{p\+1}^{i \+ 1, j} \subseteq \partial_{p\+1}^{1, j}$ implies the largest number of non-zeros in any matrix in~\eqref{eq:betti_four} is $O(\max\{p\, i, (p+1)\,j\})$.
As a result, we have the following corollary:
\begin{corollary}
	Given a filtration $K_\bullet$ of size $n = \lvert K_{i}^{(p)} \rvert$ and $m = \lvert K_{j}^{(p+1)} \rvert$ and two indices $i \in [n]$, $j \in [m]$, computing $\beta_p^{i,j}$ can be done in time and storage complexity $O(\max \{\, R_\partial(n, i, p), \, R_\partial(m, j, p+1) \,\})$ where $R_\partial(a,b,c)$ is the complexity of computing the rank of a $c$-dimensional $a\times b$ boundary matrix with $b\cdot (c+1)$ non-zero $\mathbb{F}$ entries. 
	%with $n < m$
\end{corollary} 
\noindent 
In the next section, we show how extend these complexity statements to parameterized settings. We address the storage and time complexity of $R_\partial(\cdot, \cdot)$ in section~\ref{sec:background_notation}.

% This subsection shows the benefits of rank(P^T A P) = rank(A)
\subsection{A Parameterized Boundary Matrix Relaxation}
One advantage of expressing the PBN via equation~\eqref{eq:betti_four} is that certain properties of rank function may be exploited in \emph{parameterized} settings, i.e. settings where the scalar-valued filter function and corresponding filtration belong to a parametric family.  
One simple such property of the rank function is permutation invariance: given any square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $\mathrm{rank}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(P^T A P)$ for any permutation matrix $P$. Observe the boundary matrices $\partial_p$ in~\eqref{eq:betti_four} need not be in filtration order induced by $(K_\bullet, f)$ to be evaluated---one may permute the matrices in~\eqref{eq:betti_four} and obtain the same Betti number, so long as the matrices have the same essential non-zero pattern. 
Another approach to tracking the PBNs in parameterized setting is through the vineyards algorithm~\cite{cohen2006vines}, however this requires $O(m^2)$ memory and an $\approx O(m^2)$ preprocessing procedure to detect changes in the filtration order\footnote{The bound $O(m^2)$ assumes the homotopy changes each filtration value monotonically throughout the homotopy. Otherwise the number of order changes is clearly unbounded.} to simulate persistence across a homotopy, the canonical continuous parameterized setting. In contrast, as we show below, PBNs need no such preprocessing procedure and may be computed in effectively $O(m)$ memory, even in parameterized settings. We elaborate in the following section. 

Recall that the boundary operator $\partial_p$ for a filtration pair $(K_{\bullet}, f)$ with $m = \lvert C_p(K_{\bullet}) \rvert$ and $n = \lvert C_{p-1}(K_{\bullet}) \rvert$ can be represented by an ordered $(n \times m)$ boundary matrix $\partial_p$ whose columns and rows correspond to $p$-simplices and $(p-1)$-simplices. After orienting $K$ in an arbitrary but consistent way, the entries of $\partial_p$ have the form: 
%Given an oriented $p$-simplex $\sigma = [v_0, v_1, \dots, v_p]$, its corresponding image under the  boundary operator $\partial_p$ is given as: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:alt_sum}
%	\partial_p(\sigma) = \partial_p([v_0, v_1, \dots, v_p]) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^p (-1)^i [v_0, \dots, \hat{v}_i, \dots v_p]
%\end{equation}
%where $\hat{v}_i$ indicates the removal of $v_i$ from the $i$th summand.  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrix_pchain}
	\partial_p[k, l] = \begin{cases} 
	c(\sigma_j)  & \text{if } \sigma_l \in \partial_p(\sigma_k) \\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $c(\sigma_\ast) \in \mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary constant satisfying $c(\sigma) = -c(\sigma')$ if $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are opposite orientations of the same simplex, typically set to $\pm 1$. In what follows, we assume a fixed orientation is given on $K$, and write $\pm c(\sigma)$ to indicate the sign of $c(\sigma)$ depends on the orientation of $\sigma$. Note the ordering of $\partial_p$ must respect the facet poset of $K_\bullet$: if $\tau, \sigma \in K_\bullet^{(p)}$ and $f(\tau) \leq f(\sigma)$, then the chain $\partial_p(\tau)$ must appear before $\partial_p(\sigma)$ in $\partial_p$. 

% Change index set
All of the notation given thus far, such as the definitions of the PH groups~\eqref{eq:hom_map} and the the PBN~\eqref{eq:pbn}, have used integer indices $(i,j) \in \Delta_+^m$ to describe the PH groups over a filtered complex $K$ of size $\lvert K \rvert = m$. Equivalently, we have thus far implicitly assumed the range of the filter function $f : K \to I$ to be the typical index set $I = [m]$. In theory, any function satisfying $f(\tau) \subseteq f(\sigma)$ for every face/coface pair $(\tau, \sigma)$ is well defined. In practice, $f$ is typically derived from geometrical settings such that $\mathrm{range}(f) = \mathbb{R}$. A common scenario is where $K_\bullet$ is obtained via a Rips filtration constructed over a metric space $(X, d_X)$. In this case $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is given as the diameter $f(\sigma) = \max_{x,x' \in \sigma} d_X(x,x')$. 
% mention DMSs 
%In many applications it is of interest to study such filter function in parameterized settings, e.g. given some set of parameters $\mathcal{H}$, the goal is to understand a given topological invariant at many  parameters $h \in \mathcal{H}$, i.e. treat $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \times \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}_+$. We include several example in section~\ref{}.

Suppose that instead of being given a fixed pair $(K_\bullet, f)$, the filter function was parameterized $f : \mathcal{H} \times K \to \mathbb{R}$ and you wanted to compute $\beta_p^{i,j}$ over $\mathcal{H}$. We give several application settings where this kind of formulation occurs naturally in section~\ref{sec:applications}. To simplify this process, we introduce the notion of a \emph{parameterized boundary matrix}.
% $\delta_{\mathcal{X}}(\cdot) = (X, d_X(\cdot))$ a DMS over a finite set $X$ of fixed size $\lvert X \rvert = n$
% TODO: fix i,j to be [n], [m]... no need for upper half plane yet 
\begin{definition}[Parameterized boundary matrix]\label{def:time_boundary_matrix}
Let $X$ denote a data set of interest of size $\lvert X \rvert = n$, equipped with parameterized filtering function $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \times \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}$. 
Define $(\mathcal{P}(X), \preceq^\ast)$ be a fixed linear extension of the face poset of the standard $(n- 1)$-simplex. For fixed $i,j \in \mathbb{R}$, define the $\mathcal{H}$-\emph{parameterized} $p$\emph{-th boundary matrix} $\hat{\partial}_p^{i, j}(h)$ \emph{at scale} $(i,j)$ to be the $\binom{n}{p} \times \binom{n}{p\+1}$ matrix ordered by $\preceq^\ast$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$, and whose entries $(k,l)$ satisfy:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j}(h)[k,l] = \begin{cases}
	\pm \, S_{i,j}(\sigma_k, \sigma_l) & \text{if } \sigma_k \in \partial_p(\sigma_l) \\
	%, \text{ where } \epsilon = f(\sigma_l) \\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
% where $S_{\omega}^{\alpha} : \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]$ is a \emph{smooth-step} function whose range decreases smoothly from $1 \to 0$ in the interval $[\alpha - \omega, \alpha]$.
where $S_{i, j} : \mathcal{P}(X) \times \mathcal{P}(X) \to \{0, 1\}$ is a \emph{step} function that accepts a face/coface pair $(\sigma_k, \sigma_l)$ and returns a $1$ if $f(\sigma_k) \geq i$ and $f(\sigma_l) \leq j$, and $0$ otherwise.
\end{definition}
\noindent
The result of definition~\ref{def:time_boundary_matrix} is that, in parameterized settings, the PBN can be written in essentially the same form as~\eqref{eq:betti_four}. To simplify the notation, we write $A^{x} = A^{\ast,x}$ for the setting where only columns up to $x$ of $A$ are being selected, and let $q = p + 1$. We also write $r(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A)$. 
\begin{align*}\label{eq:pbn_parameterized}
	\beta_p^{i,j} : \mathcal{H} &\to \mathbb{N} \\
	& h\mapsto \lvert K_i^{(p)}(h) \rvert  -  (\mathrm{r} \circ \hat{\partial}_{p}^{i})(h) - (\mathrm{r} \circ \hat{\partial}_{q}^{j})(h) + (\mathrm{r} \circ \hat{\partial}_{q}^{i \+ \epsilon, j})(h) \numberthis
\end{align*}
% deflation?
One remark is in order: note that although definition~\ref{def:time_boundary_matrix} specifies $\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j}$ as a full $\binom{n}{p} \times \binom{n}{q}$ matrix, implying a memory complexity of $O(q\cdot n^{q})$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$, we remark that there is no need to fully allocate this much memory as the rows/columns corresponding to the set of $p$/$q$ face/coface pairs $(\sigma_k, \sigma_l)$ with $f(\sigma_l) < i$ or $f(\sigma_k) > j$ are entirely $0$. 
As we will show below, it is enough to have access to the simplices $K_j^{(q)}(h)$. % and $\bar{K}_i^{(p)}(h)$?

% In general, computing dgm_p(X) for p \geq 1 requires O(\lvert X \rvert^{3(p+2)}) [ p = 1 <=> O(n^9), p=2 <=> O(n^12)] (curvature sets paper) and O(\lvert X \rvert^{2(p+2)}) memory.

% Benefits of rank(A) = rank(A^T A) = rank(A A^T)
\subsection{Laplacian Connection}
% Spectral graph theory plug
% Due to its connection as the discrete analogue of the Laplace differential operator, the graph Laplacian and its spectrum have been studied in many areas of mathematical research as they often have particular geometric interpretations in physical chemistry, and financial mathematics~\cite{}. Since the investigation of the question ``can you hear the shape of a drum?'' by~\cite{}, the question of what geometric properties of a manifold are determined by its Laplace operator has been of pertinent interest to practitioners and theoreticians alike. 


Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with edge set $E \subseteq V \times V$, let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ denote its corresponding \emph{adjacency matrix} with non-zero entries $A[i,j] = 1$ for every $(i, j) \in E$, and $0$ otherwise. The \emph{graph Laplacian} $L$ is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
	L = D - A = \partial_1 \partial_1^T
\end{equation} 
where $D$ is a diagonal matrix whose entries $d_{ii} = \{ \, \mathrm{deg}(v_i) \, \}$ are the vertex degrees $\mathrm{deg}(v_i) = \sum_{j \neq i} A[i,j]$. 
The graph Laplacian and its many variants~\cite{} are well studied. Structurally, they admit a number are attractive features: $L$ is symmetric and thus its eigenvalues are real-valued; $L$ is positive semi-definite ($L \succeq 0$) and thus satisfies $x^T L x \geq 0$ for all $x \neq 0$; 
$\mathrm{rank}(L)$ is given by $n - \mathrm{cc}(G)$, where $\mathrm{cc}(G)$ is the number of connected components of $G$ (and thus, $0 \in \Lambda(L)$ with multiplicity $\mathrm{cc}(G)$). 
In particular, the linear and quadratic forms $L$ admits have particular graph interpretations:
\begin{flalign*}
	(\, \forall \, x \in \mathbb{R}^n \,)  & & \quad\quad\quad 
	(Lx)_i = \mathrm{deg}(v_i) \cdot x_i - \sum\limits_{i \sim j} x_j \, , \quad \quad &
	 x^T L x = \sum\limits_{i \sim j} (x_i - x_j)^2  & &&
\end{flalign*}
where we use the notation $i \sim j$ to indicate vertices $i,j \in V$ are path-connected in $G$. The graph Laplacian is generally known to capture the connectivity structure of $G$. To make this more concrete, we adapt an example from~\cite{newman2001laplacian}. Suppose the vertices of $G$ are ordered and labeled from $1$ to $n$ arbitrarily such that, given any subset $X \subseteq V$, we may define column vector $x = (\, x_i\, )$ whose components $x_i = 1$ indicate $i \in X$ and $x_i = 0$ otherwise. Given such a set $X \subseteq V$, let $X' = V \setminus X$ denote its complement set and $c_v(X) = \{ (v,w) \in E \mid v \in X \text{ and } w \in V \setminus X \}$ its \emph{cutset} restricted to $v$, i.e. the set of edges having as one endpoint $v \in X$ and another endpoint outside of $X$. 
%Given $y = L x$, we have: 
By $L$'s definition, we have:
\begin{align*}
	(Lx)_i > 0 &\Longleftrightarrow i \in X \text{ and } \lvert c_i(X) \rvert = (Lx)_i  \\
	(Lx)_i < 0 &\Longleftrightarrow i \in X' \text{ and } \lvert c_i(X') \rvert = \lvert (Lx)_i \rvert \\
	(Lx)_i = 0 &\Longleftrightarrow i \in X \cup X' \text{ and } c_i(X) = \emptyset
\end{align*}
In other words, $L$ captures exactly how $X$ is connected to the rest of $G$. Notice that if $X  = V$, then $y = 0$ and thus $0$ must be an eigenvalue of $L$. The interpretation extends can be generalized to powers of $L$, wherein just as entries in $A^k$ model paths, entries in $L^k$ are seen to model boundaries~\cite{newman2001laplacian}.

In general, the spectrum of the graph Laplacian $L$ is unbounded,~\cite{} and instead many prefer to work within the ``normalized'' setting where eigenvalues are bounded and carry a particular form. Define the \emph{normalized Laplacian} $\mathcal{L}$ of a graph $G$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}(G) = D^{-1/2} L D^{-1/2}
\end{equation} 
with the convention that $D^{-1}(v_i,v_i) = 0$ for $\mathrm{deg}(v_i) = 0$. 
Note that $\mathcal{L}(G)$ can also be written in a form $\partial_1 \partial_1^T$ by replacing entries column entries $(1,-1)$ corresponding to edges $e = (u,v)$ with $(1 /\sqrt{\mathrm{deg(u)}}, -1 /\sqrt{\mathrm{deg(v)}})$~\cite{ChungSGT}.
The variational characterization of eigenvalues in terms of the Rayleigh quotient of $\mathcal{L}$ convey a particular form. Specifically, for any real-valued function $f : V \to \mathbb{R}$ on $G$, when viewed as a column vector, $\mathcal{L}$ satisfies:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lap_rayleigh}
	\frac{\langle f, \mathcal{L} f \rangle}{\langle f, f \rangle} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i \sim j} (g(v_i) - g(v_j))^2}{\sum\limits_{i} g(v_i)^2  \cdot \mathrm{deg}(v_i) }
\end{equation}
where $f = D^{1/2} g$ and $\langle f, g\rangle$ denotes the standard inner product in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Equation~\eqref{eq:lap_rayleigh} may be used to show that the spectrum $\Lambda(\mathcal{L})$ is bounded in the interval $[0, 2]$. In particular, it is known that:
\begin{equation}
	\lambda_i \leq \sup_{f} \frac{\langle f, \mathcal{L} f \rangle}{\langle f, f \rangle} \leq 2
\end{equation}
Recall that, when $G$ is connected, $0$ is an eigenvalue of both $L$ and $\mathcal{L}(G)$, with multiplicity $\mathrm{cc}(G)$. Moreover, if $G$ is the union of disjoint graphs $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_k$, then it has as its spectrum the union of the spectra $ \Lambda(G_1), \Lambda(G_2), \dots, \Lambda(G_k)$. 
Certain parts of the spectrum of $\mathcal{L}$ can be deduced explicitly for very structured types of $G$, such as complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs, path graphs, and cycle graphs, and $n$-cubes. 
For a list of additional properties the graph and normalized Laplacians satisfy, including bounds on eigenvalues, relation to random walks and rapidly-mixing Markov chains,  identities tied to isoperimetric properties of graphs, and explicit connections to spectral Riemannian geometry, see~\cite{chung1997spectral} and references within.

% The Spectrum of the Laplacian in Riemannian 	Geometry
% The spectrum does not in general determine the geometry of a manifold. Nevertheless, some geometric information can be extracted from the spectrum. In what follows, we define a spectral invariant to be anything that is completely determined by the spectrum



% TODO: UNDERSTAND THE FOURTH TERM 
The graph laplacian appears naturally in the computation of $\beta_0^\ast$. Consider the rank expression from~\eqref{eq:betti_four}. Since $\partial_0$ is trivial, the expression reduces to: 
\begin{equation}
	\beta_p^{i,j} = \lvert K_i^{(0)}\rvert - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{1}^{j}) + \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{1}^{i \+ 1, j} )
\end{equation} 
Since $\mathrm{rank}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A A^T) = \mathrm{rank}(A^T A)$, we may equivalently express the second and third terms in terms of their graph Laplacians. Let $G_j = \mathcal{L}(K_j)$ denote the graph of $K_j$...
%as $\mathrm{rank}(L(K_j))$ and $\mathrm{rank}(L(K_j \cap \bar{K}_i))$, where $\bar{K}_i = K_\bullet \setminus K_i$ denotes the complement. Since the rank of any (irreducible) graph Laplacian may be deduced by counting the connected components of the underlying graph, we deduce that the complexity of computing $\beta_0^{i,j}$ reduces to the complexity 
% TODO: compute this for small example to verify Laplacians

For $p \geq 1$, the PBN expression can still be generalized via \emph{up Laplacians}. The higher-dimensional generalizations of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes have been studied in a variety of settings, see e.g.~\cite{}. 
In particular, given $K$ a finite oriented simplicial complex and some $p \geq 0$, the $p$-th \emph{combinatorial Laplacian} of $K$ is the linear operator $\mathcal{L}_p : C_p \to C_p$ given by: 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_p = \partial_{p\+1} \circ \partial_{p\+1}^T + \partial_{p}^T \circ \partial_{p}
\end{equation}
For convenience, we use the notation ${\uparrow}L_p = \partial_{p\+1} \circ \partial_{p\+1}^T$ and ${\downarrow}L_{p} = \partial_{p}^T \circ \partial_{p}$ to denote the so-called \emph{up} and \emph{down} combinatorial $p$-th Laplacians, respectively. 
With this notation, notice the computation of the PBN can be expressed via the ranks of up Laplacians...

%We now show a few properties that the rank-based formula $\beta_p^{i,j}$ exhibits that are advantageous in parameterized settings. 
%The first such property is a simple parameterized relaxation of PBN:
%\begin{align*}
%	\hat{\beta}_p^{i,j} &= \lvert K_i^{(p)} \rvert - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p}^{i}) - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{q}^{j}) + \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j} ) \\
%%	&= \lvert K_i^{(p)} \rvert - \mathrm{rank}((\partial_{p}^{i})(\partial_{p}^{i})^T) - \mathrm{rank}(\underbrace{(\partial_{q}^{j})(\partial_{q}^{j})^T}_{\uparrow\mathcal{L}_1^i}) + \mathrm{rank}((\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j})(\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j})^T)
%&= \lvert K_i^{(p)} \rvert - \mathrm{rank}((\partial_{p}^{i})(\partial_{p}^{i})^T) - \mathrm{rank}((\partial_{q}^{j})(\partial_{q}^{j})^T) + \mathrm{rank}( (\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j})(\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j})^T)\\
%&= \lvert K_i^{(p)} \rvert - \mathrm{rank}(L_p^i) - \mathrm{rank}(L_q^j) + \mathrm{rank}(L_q^{i\+1,j}) \numberthis
%\end{align*}

% \hat{\beta}_p^{i,j} = \sum\limits_{\underset{\lvert \sigma \rvert = p+1}{\sigma \in \mathcal{P}(X)}} \mathrm{sgn}\left( \; \lvert i - f(\sigma) \rvert_{\+} \right)  - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p}^{i}) - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{q}^{j}) + \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{q}^{i \+ 1, j} )

%Clearly the entries of $\partial_p(t)$ now vary smoothly in $t \in T$. Moreover, for fixed $p \geq 0$, we have:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item $\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^t) = \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{B}_{p-1}(K_t))$ for all $t \in T$ 
%	\item $\lVert \partial_p^t - \partial_p^{t'} \rVert_F \sim O(m_p)$ when $\delta_\mathcal{X}$ is $C$-Lipshitz over $T$ and $\lvert t - t' \rvert$ is small,
%	\item $\lVert \partial_p^t \rVert_{2} \leq \epsilon \sqrt{\kappa} \, (p+1)$ where $\kappa = \max \sum\limits_{t \in T}\sum\limits_{\sigma \in K_t}\mathds{1}(\mathrm{diam}(\sigma) \leq \epsilon)$
%	%\sqrt{\epsilon\,\kappa\,(p+1)}$ where $\kappa = \max \sum\limits_{t \in T}\sum\limits_{\sigma \in K_t}\mathds{1}(\mathrm{diam}(\sigma) \leq \epsilon)$ %$C(n,k) = \binom{n}{k}$
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rank Computation}
In this section we discuss a few iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrices. In particular, we focus on the Lanczos iteration, and related adaptations to positive semi-definite, diagonally dominant (DD) and strictly diagonally dominant (SDD) cases. We also show, where applicable, how these methods made be adapted to efficiently compute~\eqref{eq:pbn_parameterized}.

%The success of iterative methods at extracting spectral-information from large, sparse matrices in the past three decades is unprecedented. Core to these methods is the Arnoldi iteration, whose specialization to symmetric matrices yields the Lanczos method~\cite{}. Although discovered before the widely successful direct methods (Householder transformations, QR factorization, etc.), the Lanczos algorithm became the staple for applications where the underlying full orthogonal decompositon of system was too large to fit into memory. reduces $A$ to tridiagonal form via a series of orthogonal similarity transformations
 
The means by which the Lanczos method estimates eigenvalues is by projecting onto successive Krylov subspaces. Given a large, sparse, symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 > \dots \geq \lambda_r > 0$ and a vector $v \neq 0$, the order-$j$ Krylov subspaces are the spaces spanned by: 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{K}_j(A, v) := \mathrm{span}\{ v, Av, A^2 v, \dots, A^{j-1} \} = \mathrm{range}(K_j(A, v))
\end{equation}
where $K_j(A, v) = [ v \mid Av \mid A^2 v \mid \dots \mid A^{j-1}]$ are the corresponding Krylov matrices. 
% The utility of Krylov subspace methods is motivated by the fact that the minimal polynomial of $A$ can be used to express $A^{-1}$ in terms of powers of $A$.
The motivation for Krylov subspaces comes from using the minimal polynomial of $A$ to express $A^{-1}$ in terms of powers of $A$. In particular, if $A$ is nonsingular and its minimal polynomial has degree $m$, then $x = A^{-1}v \in K_m(A, v)$ and $K_m(A, v)$ is an invariant subspace of $A$.
% "Krylov subspace methods for shifted unitary matrices and eigenvalue deflation applied to the Neuberger Operator and the matrix sign function"
%A non-trivial fact that motivates the use of Krylov subspaces is that subspace $K_n(A, v)$ is the smallest $A$-invariant space that contains $v$. 
%The vectors $A^j v$ are proportional to those obtained through power iteration and tend to be good approximations to the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues.
This observation combined with the fact $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable (since $A$ is symmetric) implies we may obtain $\Lambda(A)$ by generating an orthonormal basis for $\mathcal{K}_n(A, v)$. 
To do this, the Lanczos method constructs successive QR factorizations of $K_j(A,v) = Q_j R_j$ for each $j = 1, 2, \dots, n$.
Due to $A$'s symmetry and the orthogonality of $Q_j$, we have $q_k^T A q_l = q_l^T A^T q_k = 0$ for $k > l + 1$, implying the corresponding $T_j = Q_j^T A Q_j$ have a tridiagonal structure:
\begin{equation}
	T_j = \begin{bmatrix} 
	\alpha_1 & \beta_1 & & & \\
	\beta_1 & \alpha_2 & \beta_2 & & \\
	 & \beta_2 & \alpha_3 & \ddots & \\
	& & \ddots & \ddots & \beta_{j-1} \\
	& & & \beta_{j-1} & \alpha_{j} 
	\end{bmatrix}, \; \beta_j > 0, \; j = 1, 2, \dots, n
\end{equation}
Unlike the spectral decomposition $A = U \Lambda U^T$, which identifies a diagonalizable $A$ with its spectrum $\Lambda(A)$ up to a change of basis $A \mapsto M^{-1} A M$, there is no canonical choice of $T_j$ due to the arbitrary choice of $v$. 
%which unitarily diagonalizes $A$ into a form such that any other decomposition $A = \tilde{U}\Lambda\tilde{U}^T$ is related by a similarity transform, 
Instead, the Lanczos method exploits a particular connection between the iterates $K_j(A,v)$ and the full tridiagonalization of $A$: if $Q^T A Q = T$ is tridiagonal and $Q= [\, q_1 \mid q_2 \mid \dots \mid q_n \,]$ is an $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix $Q Q^T = I_n$, then:
\begin{equation}
	K_n(A, q_1) = Q Q^T K_n(A, q_1) = Q[ \, e_1 \mid T e_1 \mid T^2 e_1 \mid \dots \mid T^{n-1} e_1 \, ]
\end{equation}
is the QR factorization of $K_n(A, q_1)$.
%that is, $Q$ may be generated completely by tridiagonalizing $A$ with respect to an orthogonal matrix $Q$ whose first column vector is $q_1$. 
The Implicit Q Theorem~\cite{golub2013matrix} asserts that if an upper Hessenburg matrix $T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ has only positive elements on its first subdiagonal and there exists an orthogonal matrix $Q$ such that $Q^T A Q = T$, then $Q$ and $T$ are \emph{uniquely} determined by $(A, q_1)$. 
Thus, given an initial pair $(A, q_1)$ satisfying $\lVert q_1 \rVert = 1$, we may restrict and project $A$ to its $j$-th Krylov subspace $T_j$ via: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:krylov_proj}
	A Q_j = Q_j T_j + \beta_j q_{j\+1} e_{j}^T
\end{equation}
where $Q_j = [\, q_1 \mid q_2 \mid \dots \mid q_j \,]$ is an orthonormal set of vectors mutually orthogonal to $q_{j\+1}$, 
%$q_{j+1} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a unit vector satisfying $q_{j+1} \perp \{ q_1, q_2, \dots, q_j \}$, 
$e_{j}$ is the standard $j$ identity vector, and $\beta_j > 0$.
Equating the $j$-th columns on each side of~\eqref{eq:krylov_proj} yields the three-term recurrence: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:three_term_rec}
	A q_j = \beta_{j\text{-}1} \, q_{j\text{-}1} + \alpha_j \, q_j + \beta_{j} \, q_{j+1}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_j = q_j^T A q_j$, $\beta_j = \lVert r_j \rVert_2$, $r_j = (A - \alpha_j I)q_j - \beta_{j\text{-}1} q_j$, and $q_{j+1} = r_j / \beta_j$. Observe that if ($q_{j\text{-}1}, \beta_j, q_j$) are known, then ($\alpha_j$, $\beta_{j+1}, q_{j+1}$) are completely determined and~\eqref{eq:three_term_rec} may be used iteratively to obtain $T_j$---this sequential process is called the \emph{Lanczos iteration}. One may begin the iteration by setting $\beta_0$ and $q_0$ to $0$, and $q_1$ arbitrarily. Note that if $A$ is singular and we encounter $\beta_j = 0$ for some $j < n$, then $\mathrm{range}(Q_j) = \mathcal{K}_j(A, q_1)$ is still an $A$-invariant subspace, the iteration stops, and we have $j = \mathrm{rank}(A)$ and $\Lambda(T_j) = \Lambda(A)$. % The spectrum is indeed identical when j = rank(A), see e.g. An Explicit Formula for Lanczos Polynomials
%This is called a projection because each $q_{j+1} \perp \{q_1, q_2, \dots, q_j \}$, and~\eqref{eq:krylov_proj} can be thought of as successive orthogonalization, 

% Computation 
The Lanczos iteration's widespread adoption is in part due to its simplicity: each step consists of just a single matrix-vector product and a few vector operations. It is often referred to as a ``black box'' method due to the fact that a fast matrix-vector product is the only aspect of the computation that explicitly depends on $A$. 
% Indeed, one need not have $A$ stored in memory explicitly: approximations of the $v \mapsto Av$ operator is all that is 
%the only aspect of the computation an implementation requires from the user-side is an efficient \emph{matvec} operator $v \mapsto Av$. 
%Whereas direct methods typically require $O(n^3)$ operations before any output is derived, 
If $A$ is sparse and/or has special structure, then the Lanczos method can be quite efficient. 
Indeed, the three-term recurrence from~\eqref{eq:three_term_rec} implies the Lanczos iteration of $A$ may be carried out with just three $O(n)$-sized vectors. 
For any symmetric $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ rank-$r$ matrix with an average of $\nu$ nonzeros per row, approximately $(2\nu + 8)n$ flops are needed for a single Lanczos step, implying a $O(n\nu r)$ time complexity for a single iteration~\cite{golub2013matrix}. In general, eigenvalue computations consist of two phases, of which the reduction to structured form (the first phase) is the bottleneck: once $T_j$ has been obtained for sufficient $j > 0$, the corresponding spectrum $\Lambda(T_j)$ may be obtained in $O(n \log n)$ time~\cite{gu1995divide}. 
%\{\, \theta_i \,\}_{i=1}^j


The sparsity pattern $\partial_p$ inherits from the simplicial structure of $K$ confers a few computational advantages compared to more general linear operators. Observe each column of $\partial_p$ corresponds to a $p$-chain of the form~\eqref{eq:matrix_pchain}, which is a constant up to difference in sign. Thus, evaluating $y = \partial_p^T v$ reduces to computing the locations $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_{p+1})$:
\begin{equation}
	y_{i} = y_i \pm S_{i,j}(\sigma_k, \sigma_l)
\end{equation}
In particular, the operator $v \mapsto \partial_p \partial_p^T v$ need not be represented explicitly in memory: as long as we have access to the underlying simplicial complex $K$ and its corresponding filter function $f$, we may take advantage of the .
To make this more precise, we start with a useful lemma:
\begin{lemma}
For any fixed $p \geq 0$, given simplicial complex $K$ with $m$ ($n$, respectively) simplices of dimension $p$ ($p - 1$, respectively) and an arbitrary vector $v$ of size $\lvert v \rvert = n$, the operation $v \mapsto \partial_p \partial_p^T v$ can be evaluated $O(\max \{m,n\})$ time and $O(\max \{m,n\})$ memory. 
\end{lemma}
From this lemma, we have the following result: 
\begin{proposition}[\cite{parlett1994we, simon1984analysis}]\label{prop:exact_arith_matvec}
	Given a simplicial complex $K$ with $m = \lvert K^{(p+1)} \rvert$ and $n = \lvert K^{(p)} \rvert$. Without loss of generality, assume $n < m$, and that $\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p) = r$. 
	Then the Lanczos iteration from~\cite{} yields the quantity:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{dim}(B_{p}(K; \mathbb{R})) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p+1}(K))
	\end{equation}
	in $O(mr)$ time and $O(m)$ storage complexity, when computation is done in exact arithmetic. 
	%	Moreover, assume we may carry out the computation $v \mapsto \partial_p \partial_p^T v$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$ in exact arithmetic in $O(m)$ time. 
\end{proposition}
\noindent A proof of this proposition is given in the appendix. 

% Rounding Issues
For expository purposes, the preceding sections assumed exact arithmetic. 


% Convergence + SDD
\noindent \textbf{Convergence Rate: }
In principle, if the Lanczos iteration doesn't break down due to rounding errors, then the characteristic polynomial of $T_k$ is the unique polynomial $p^k \in P^k$ that achieves~\cite{}:
\begin{equation}
	\lVert p^k(A)b \rVert = {minimum}
\end{equation}
% the explicit formulas of the of the characteristic polynomials of $A_k$ are given in..., wherein the convergenence of the Lanczos procedure is studied more in detail.
In fact, there is more we can say: if $S = \mathcal{K}_k(A, q_1)$, then applying the Lanczos iteration yield the \emph{Ritz pairs} $(\theta, y)$ of $A$, which are the pairs satisfying $w^T (Ay - \theta y) = 0$ for all $w \in S$.
The essential result from~\cite{} is that the eigenvalues $\Lambda(T_k) = \{\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_k \}$ are `optimal' in the sense that $T_k = B$ is the matrix that minimizes  $\lVert A Q_k - Qk B \rVert_2$ over the space of all $k \times k$ matrices. Thus, if $\mathrm{rank}(A) = r$, the eigenvalues of $T_k$ for some $k < r$ tend to converge quickly to the extremal eigenvalues of $A$. 
% Rayleigh 
% the explicit formulas of the of the characteristic polynomials of $A_k$ are given in...
% where $S_k^T T_k S_k = \mathrm{diag}\{\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_k \}$ satisfying $T_k = \lVert A Q_k - Qk B \rVert_2$
The iteration typically converges geometrically and can be stopped as soon as the desired accuracy is reached.

The structure of $L_p = \partial_p \partial_p^T$ is actually amenable to more than just computational efficiency in terms of matrix-vector multiplication. A matrix $A = \{ a_{ij} \}$ is said to be \emph{diagonally dominant} (DD) if it satisfies: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dd}
a_{ii} \geq \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \, \lvert a_{ij} \rvert \,, \quad \forall \, i,j \in [n]
\end{equation}  
Similarly, when the inequality in~\eqref{eq:dd} is strict, $A$ is said to be \emph{strictly diagonally dominant} (SDD). 
It is well known that for any $p \geq 0$, $L_p$ is the smallest diagonally dominant matrix in the sense that $L_p[i,i] = \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \lvert L_p[i,j] \rvert$. Diagonally dominant matrices are of particular interest becsue.... their spectrums can be approximated rather quickly. 


%Extending from this, corollary~\ref{} implies $p$-th PBN at index $(i,j) \in \Delta_{+}^{m}$ can be computed in... note that for any $p \geq 1$, this is significant reduction in complexity compared to e.g. the $O(m^3)$ reduction algorithm.
%Indeed, if $K$ has $n$ vertices, the $\Theta(m^3)$ complexity of the reduction algorithm implies computing the $p$-th persistence diagram requires reducing $\partial_{p+1}$; one deduces loose though asymptotically accurate bounds as $O(n^3(p+2))$ operations, i.e. $O(n^9)$ for $p = 1$, $O(n^{12})$ for $p = 2$, etc. In contrast, combining proposition~\ref{prop:exact_arith_matvec} with corollary~\ref{}, we have that the PBN at index $i,j$ may be compute in... a substantial difference indeed. 
%Obviously, the assumption of exact arithmetic is too strong to be of any practical use. Round-off errors plague the simple Lanczos iteration.

\subsection*{Persistent Homology Transform}
Given a simplicial complex $K$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) is a shape statistic that establishes a fundamental connection between the topological information summarized by $K$'s PH groups and the geometry of its associated embedding. 

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ denote a data set which can be written as a finite simplicial complex $K$, define the parameterized filtration $K(v)_\alpha$ for any unit vector $v \in S^{d-1}$ up to index $\alpha$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	K(v)_\alpha = \{\, x \in X \mid \langle x, v \rangle \leq \alpha  \,\}
\end{equation}
We write $K(v)$ to indicate the filtration of $K$ for all $\alpha$. Conceptually, the $p$-th dimensional persistence diagram $\mathrm{dgm}_p(K, v)$ summaries how the topology of the filtration $K(v)$ changes in the direction of  $v$. Similarly, the PHT summarizes how the topology of $K$ changes in \emph{all} directions; given a complex $K$ built from $X$, it is defined as: 
\begin{align*}\label{eq:pht}
	\mathrm{PHT}(K): S^{d-1} &\to \mathcal{D}^d \\
	v &\mapsto \left( \, \mathrm{dgm}_0(K, v), \mathrm{dgm}_1(K, v), \dots, \mathrm{dgm}_{d-1}(K, v) \, \right)\numberthis
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{D}$ denotes the space of $p$-dimensional persistence diagrams, for all $p = 0, \dots, d-1$ and $S^{d-1}$ the unit $d-1$ sphere. The stability of persistence diagrams ensures that the map $v \mapsto \mathrm{dgm}_p(K, v)$ is Lipschitz with respect to the bottleneck distance metric $d_B(\cdot, \cdot)$ whenever $K$ is a finite simplicial complex, thus the PHT may be thought of naturally as a parameterized family of diagrams.

The primary result of~\cite{} is that the PHT is injective on the space of subsets of $R^d$ that can be written as finite simplicial complexes\footnote{Implicit in the injectivity statement of the PHT is that, given a subset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ which may be written as finite simplicial complex $K$, the restriction $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ to any simplex in $K$ must is linear.}, which we denote as $\mathcal{K}_d$. 
Equivalently, $\mathcal{K}_d$ decomposes space of all pairs $(K, f)$ under the equivalence $(K, f) \sim (K,f')$ when $f(K) = f'(K)$.

\appendix
\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Proofs}
\subsubsection*{Proof of Lemma 1}
\begin{proof}
	The Pairing Uniqueness Lemma~\cite{dey2022computational} asserts that if $R = \partial V$ is a decomposition of the total $m \times m$ boundary matrix $\partial$, then for any $1 \leq i < j \leq m$ we have $\mathrm{low}_R[j] = i$ if and only if $r_\partial(i,j) = 1$. 
	As a result, for $1 \leq i < j \leq m$, we have:
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{low}_R[j] = i \iff r_R(i,j) \neq 0 \iff r_\partial(i,j) \neq 0
\end{equation} 
Extending this result to equation~\eqref{eq:lower_left_rank} can be seen by observing that in the decomposition, $R = \partial V$, the matrix $V$ is full-rank and obtained from the identity matrix $I$ via a sequence of rank-preserving (elementary) left-to-right column additions.  
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Proof of Proposition 1}
\begin{proof}
We first need to show that $\beta_p^{i,j}$ can be expressed as a sum of rank functions. Note that by the rank-nullity theorem, so we may rewrite~\eqref{eq:pbn} as:
%$$ \beta_p^{i,j} = \mathrm{dim} \left( Z_p(K_i) \right) - \mathrm{dim}\left( Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \right ) $$
$$ \beta_p^{i,j} = \mathrm{dim} \left( C_p(K_i) \right) - \mathrm{dim} \left( B_{p-1}(K_i) \right) - \mathrm{dim}\left( Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \right ) $$
The dimensions of groups $C_p(K_i)$ and $B_p(K_i)$ are given directly by the ranks of diagonal and boundary matrices, yielding:  
$$
	\beta_p^{i,j} = \mathrm{rank}(I_p^{1, i}) - \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^{1,i}) - \mathrm{dim}\left( Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \right )
$$
To express the intersection term, note that we need to find a way to express the number of $p$-cycles born at or before index $i$ that became boundaries before index $j$. 
Observe that the non-zero columns of $R_{p \+ 1}$ with index at most $j$ span $B_p(K_j)$, i.e $\{ \, \mathrm{col}_{R_{p\texttt{+}1}[k] } \neq 0 \mid \, k \in [j] \,\} \in \mathrm{Im}(\partial_{p+1}^{1,j})$. Now, since the low entries of the non-zero columns of $R_{p \+ 1}$ are unique, we have:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:s1}
	\mathrm{dim}(Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_i)) = \lvert \Gamma_p^{i,j} \rvert
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_p^{i,j}  = \{ \, \mathrm{col}_{R_{p\texttt{+}1}[k] } \neq 0 \mid \, k \in [j], \, 1 \leq \mathrm{low}_{R_{p\texttt{+}1}}[k] \leq i \,\}$. Consider the complementary matrix $\bar{\Gamma}_p^{i,j}$, given by the non-zero columns of $R_{p \+ 1}$ with index at most $j$ that are not in $\Gamma_p^{i,j}$, i.e. the columns satisfying $\mathrm{low}_{R_{p\texttt{+}1}}[k] > i$. Combining rank-nullity with the observation above, we have: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:s2}
	 \lvert \bar{\Gamma}_p^{i,j} \rvert = \mathrm{dim}(B_p(K_j)) - \lvert \Gamma_p^{i,j} \rvert = \mathrm{rank}(R_{p\+1}^{i\+1,j})
\end{equation}
Combining equations~\eqref{eq:s1} and~\eqref{eq:s2} yields:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:s3}
	\mathrm{dim}(Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j))  = \lvert \Gamma_p^{i,j}  \rvert 
	= \mathrm{dim}(B_p(K_j)) -  \lvert \bar{\Gamma}_p^{i,j}  \rvert 
	= \mathrm{rank}(R_{p\+1}^{1, j}) - \mathrm{rank}(R_{p\+1}^{i\+1,j})
\end{equation}
Observing the final matrices in~\eqref{eq:s3} are \emph{lower-left} submatrices of $R_{p\+1}$, the final expression~\eqref{eq:betti_four} follows by applying Lemma~\ref{lemma:rank} repeatedly. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Proof of boundary matrix properties}
\begin{proof}
First, consider property (1). For any $t \in T$, applying the boundary operator $\partial_p$ to $K_t = \mathrm{Rips}_\epsilon(\delta_{\mathcal{X}}(t))$ with non-zero entries satisfying~\eqref{eq:matrix_pchain} by definition yields a matrix $\partial_p$ satisfying $\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p) = \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{B}_{p-1}(K_t))$. In contrast, definition~\eqref{def:time_boundary_matrix} always produces $p$-boundary matrices of $\Delta_n$; however, notice that the only entries which are non-zero are precisely those whose simplices $\sigma$ that satisfy $\mathrm{diam}(\sigma) < \epsilon$. Thus, $\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^t) = \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{B}_{p-1}(K_t))$ for all $t \in T$. 
$<$ (show proof of (2))$>$
Property (3) follows from the construction of $\partial_p$ and from the inequality $\lVert A \rVert_2 \leq \sqrt{m} \lVert A \rVert_1$ for an $n \times m$ matrix $A$, as $\lVert \partial_p^t \rVert_1 \leq (p+1) \, \epsilon$ for all $t \in T$.

	% Assume that $\delta_{\mathcal{X}}$ is $C$-Lipshitz. Then $d_X(t)(x, x') \leq C d_X(t')(x, x')$ for all $x, x' \in X$, then observe $\partial_p^\ast$. 
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Dynamic Metric Spaces}
Consider an $\mathbb{R}$-parameterized metric space $\delta_X = ( X, d_X(\cdot) )$ where
$X$ is a finite set and $d_X(\cdot): \mathbb{R} \times X \times X \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$, satisfying: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For every $t \in \mathbb{R}, \delta_X(t) = (X, d_X(t))$ is a pseudo-metric space\footnote{This is required so that if one can distinguish the two distinct points $x, x' \in X$ incase $d_X(t)(x, x') = 0$ at some $t \in \mathbb{R}$. } 
	\item For fixed $x, x' \in X$, $d_X(\cdot)(x, x'): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$ is continuous.
\end{enumerate}
When the parameter $t \in \mathbb{R}$ is interpreted as \emph{time}, the above yields a natural characterization of a ``time-varying'' metric space. More generally, we refer to an $\mathbb{R}^h$-parameterized metric space as \emph{dynamic metric space}(DMS). Such space have been studied more in-depth~\cite{} and have been shown...
 

%\subsection*{Rank relaxation}
%A common approach in the literature to optimize quantities involving $\mathrm{rank}(A)$ for some $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is to consider optimizing its \emph{nuclear norm} $\lVert A \rVert_\ast = \mathrm{tr}(\sqrt{A^T A}) = \sum_{i=1}^r \lvert \sigma_i \rvert$, where $\sigma_i$ denotes the $i$th singular value of $A$ and $r=\mathrm{rank}(A)$. One of the primary motivations for this substitution is that the nuclear norm is a convex envelope of the rank function over the set: 
%$$
%S := \{ A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} \mid \lVert A \rVert_2 \leq m \}
%$$
%That is, for an appropriate $m > 0$, the function $A \mapsto \frac{1}{m}\lVert A \rVert_\ast$ is a lower convex envelope of the rank function over $S$. The nuclear norm also admits a subdifferential... thus, we may consider replacing~\eqref{} with: 
%\begin{align}\label{eq:betti_four_nuc}
%	\beta_p^{i,j}(t) &= \lvert \partial_{p,t}^{1,i} \rvert -
%	m_1\inv \lVert \partial_{p,t}^{1,i} \rVert_\ast - 
%	m_2\inv \lVert \partial_{\bar{p},t}^{1,j}\rVert_\ast - 
%	m_3\inv \lVert\partial_{\bar{p},t}^{\bar{i},j}\rVert_\ast 
%\end{align}
%where $\bar{c} = c + 1$. Now, if $t \mapsto \partial_p^\ast(t)$ is a non-decreasing, convex function in $t$, then the composition ... is convex, as each of the individual terms are convex. Moreover, we have...

%\subsection*{Computation}
%In this section, we discuss the computation of suitable bases for the subspaces $Z_p(X_\ast)$, $B_p(K_\ast)$, and $Z_p(X_\ast) \cap B_p(X_\ast)$. In particular, we address two cases: the \emph{dense} case, wherein the aforementioned bases are represented densely in memory, and the \emph{sparse} case, which uses the structure of a particular decomposition of the boundary matrices to derive bases whose size in memory inherits the sparsity pattern of the decomposition.
%\\
%\\
%\textbf{Sparse case:} We require an appropriate choice of bases for the groups $B_{p-1}(K_\ast)$ and $Z_p(X_\ast) \cap B_p(X_\ast)$. 
%For some fixed $t \in T$, let $R_p = \partial_p V_p$ denote the decomposition discussed above, and let $b, d \in \mathbb{R}_+$ be fixed constants satisfying $b \leq d$. Since the boundary group $B_{p-1}(K_b)$ lies in the image of the $\partial_{p}$, it can be shown that a basis for the boundary group $B_{p-1}(K_\ast)$ is given by: 
%\begin{flalign}
%	&& M_p^b = \{ \, \mathrm{col}_{R_{p+1}}(j) \neq 0 \mid j \leq b \, \}  && span()
%\end{flalign}
%Moreover, since $B_{p-1}(K_b) = \mathrm{Im}(\partial_p^b)$, we have $\mathrm{span}(M_p^b) = B_{p-1}(K_b)$ and thus $\mathrm{rank}(M_p^b) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^b)$. Indeed, it can be shown that every lower-left submatrix of $\partial_p^\ast$ satisfies $\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^\ast) = \mathrm{rank}(R_p^\ast)$. Thus, although $M_p^b$ does provide a minimal basis for the boundary group $B_{p-1}(K_b)$, it is unneeded here. 
%
%A suitable basis for the cycle group can also be read off from the reduced decomposition directly as well. Indeed, let $R_p = \partial_p V_p$ as before. Then the cycle group is spanned by linear combinations of columns of $V_p$: 
%\begin{equation}
%	Z_p^b = \{ \, \mathrm{col}_{V_p}(j) \mid \mathrm{col}_{R_{p}}(j) = 0, j \leq b \, \}	
%\end{equation}
%The formulation of a basis spanning $Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j)$ is more subtle, as we can no longer use the  fact that every lower-left submatrix of $R_p$ has the same rank as the same lower-left submatrix of $\partial_p$. 
%Nonetheless, a basis for this group can be obtained by reading off specific columns from $R_p$: 
%\begin{equation}
%	M_p^{b, d} := \{\, \mathrm{col}_{R_{p+1}}(k) \neq 0 \mid 1 \leq k \leq d \text{ and } 1 \leq \mathrm{low}_\mathrm{R_{p+1}}(k) \leq b \, \}
%\end{equation}
%%\begin{flalign}
%%	(\, Z_p(K_i) \cap B_p(K_j) \, ) && M_p^{b, d} := \{\, \mathrm{col}_{R_p}(k) \mid 1 \leq k \leq d \text{ and } 1 \leq \mathrm{low}_\mathrm{R_p}(k) \leq b \, \} &&
%%\end{flalign}
%One can show that $M_b^d$ does indeed span $Z_p(X_\ast) \cap B_p(X_\ast)$ by using the fact that the non-zero columns of $R_p$ with indices at most at most $d$ form a basis for $B_p(K_d)$, and that each low-row index for every non-zero is unique. 
%%The issue here is that 
%\\
%\\
%\noindent
%\textbf{Dense case:} 
%In general, persistent homology groups and its various factor groups are well-defined and computable with the reduction algorithm with coefficients chosen over any ring. By applying operations with respect to a field $\mathbb{F}$, both the various group structures $Z_p(K_\bullet) \subseteq B_p(K_\bullet)  \subseteq C_p(K_\bullet) $ and their induced quotient groups $H_p(K_\bullet)$ are vector spaces; thus, the computation of suitable bases can be approached from a purely linear algebraic perspective.
%In particular, by fixing $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$, we inherit not only many useful tools for obtaining suitable bases for these groups, but also access to their corresponding optimized implementations as well. 
%
%Consider the $p$-th boundary operator $\partial_p^\ast : C_p(K_\ast) \to C_{p-1}(K_\ast)$ whose matrix realization with respect to some choice of simplex ordering $\{\sigma_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ we also denote with $\partial_p$. By definition, the boundary group $B_p(K_\ast)$ is given by the image $\mathrm{Im}(\partial_{p+1}^\ast) = B_p(K_\ast)$, thus one may basis for $B_p(K_\ast)$ by computing the considering the first $r > 0$  columns of the reduced SVD: 
%\begin{equation}
%	M_p^\ast = [\, u_1 \mid u_2 \mid \dots \mid u_r \, ] = \{ \,  \, \}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%\subsection{Old}
%
%We consider the problem of maximizing the $p$-th \emph{persistent} Betti number $\beta^{i,j}_p$ over some set $T \subseteq \mathrm{T}$: 
%\begin{equation}
%	t_\ast = \argmax_{t \in T}	 \beta_{p}^{i,j}(t)
%\end{equation}
%As an illustrative example, see Figure. 
%$<$ insert SW1Pers vineyards plot $>$



%Since Betti numbers are integer-valued invariants, direct optimization is difficult. Moreover, the space of persistence diagrams is [banach space statement]....
%Nonetheless, the differentiability of persistence has been studied extensively in [show chain rule paper on persistence diagrams]...



%For a fixed $t \in T$, we obtain a boundary matrix $\partial_{p}^{b,d}$ up to filtration value (diameter) $d \in \mathbb{R}$ for $d_X(t)$. We recall the integer-valued function (equation~\eqref{eq:pb_rank}) we would like to relax. To do this, we substitute the nuclear norm $\lVert \, \cdot \, \rVert_\ast$  for the $\mathrm{rank}$ function and a sigmoid-like function $S_b : K \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$ for the order function $\lvert \, \cdot \, \rvert$, obtaining: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:relaxation_pb}
%\hat{\beta}_p^{b,d} = S_b(K) - \lVert \partial_p^b \rVert_{\ast} - \lVert \partial_p^{b,d} \rVert_\ast
%\end{equation} 
%where $S_b(K) = \sum_{\sigma \in K} \mathrm{sigmoid}(\lvert b - \mathrm{diam}(\sigma)\rvert)$.
%Our choice of the nuclear norm is motivated by the fact that it is often used due to its close relationship to the rank function, as first observed by Fazel et al~\cite{} (we discuss this more in section~\ref{}). 

%$<$ TODO: the goal $>$
%First, we that prove the following properties of equation~\eqref{eq:relaxation_pb}:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item If $t^\ast = \argmin\limits_{t \in T} \beta_{p}^{b,d}$ and $\hat{t}^\ast = \argmin\limits_{t \in T} \hat{\beta}_{p}^{b,d}$, then $t^\ast = \hat{t}^\ast$
%	\item $\hat{\beta}_{p}^{b,d}(t)$ is continuous as a function of $t \in T$
%	\item $\hat{\beta}_{p}^{b,d}(t)$ admits a subgradient $\hat{\beta}_{p}^{b,d}(t)$
%\end{enumerate}
%We first begin with properties (2) and (3). (2) is obvious... To see (3), consider:
%Equation~\eqref{eq:relaxation_pb} admits a differentiable form amenable to optimization. 
%\begin{equation}
%	\nabla \hat{\beta}_p^{b,d} = \nabla S_b(K) - \nabla \lVert \partial_p^b \rVert_{\ast} \cdot J_b - \nabla \lVert \partial_p^{b,d} \rVert_\ast \cdot J_{b,d}
%\end{equation}
%For any matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ whose corresponding singular value decomposition (SVD) is $M = U \Sigma V^T $, the characterization of the (sub)gradient of $\lVert M \rVert_\ast$ is given by\cite{}: 
%\begin{equation}
%	\partial\|M\|_{*}=\left\{U V^T + W: P_{U} W=0, W P_{V}=0,\|W\| \leq 1\right\}
%\end{equation}
%where $P_U$ ($P_V$, resp.) is an orthogonal projector onto the column space of $U$ ($V$, resp.). For simplicity we set $W = 0$ and obtain: % TODO: write as functional way
% \begin{equation}
%	\nabla \hat{\beta}_p^{b,d} = \nabla S_b(K) - U_b V_b^T J_b - U_{b,d} V_{b,d}^T J_{b,d}
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Application: Time-varying }
Let $\delta_\mathcal{X}$ denote an $\mathrm{T}$-parameterized metric space $\delta_\mathcal{X}(\cdot) = ( X, d_X(\cdot) )$, where $d_X: \mathrm{T} \times X \times X \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is called a \emph{time-varying metric}  and $X$ is a finite set with fixed cardinality $\lvert X \rvert = n$. $\delta_X$ as called a \emph{dynamic metric space} (DMS) iff $d_X(\cdot)(x, x')$ is continuous for every pair $x, x' \in X$ and $\delta_\mathcal{X}(t) = (X, d_X(t))$ is a pseudo-metric space for every $t \in \mathrm{T}$. 
For a fixed $t \in \mathrm{T}$, the Rips complex at scale $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ is the abstract simplicial complex given by 
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Rips_{\epsilon}}(\delta_\mathcal{X}(t)) := \{ \sigma \subset X : d_X(t)(x, x') \leq \epsilon \text{ for all } x, x' \in \sigma \}
\end{equation}
\noindent As before, the family of Rips complexes for varying $\epsilon > 0$ yields a filtration whose inclusion maps induce linear maps at the level of homology. The time-varying counterpart is analogous.  
In this context, we write the $p$-th persistent Betti number with respect to fixed values $i,j \in I$ as a function of $t \in \mathrm{T}$: 
\begin{equation}
\beta_{p}^{i,j}(t) = \left(\mathrm{dim} \circ \mathrm{H}_p^{i,j} \circ \mathrm{Rips} \circ \delta_\mathcal{X} \right)(t)
\end{equation}

\section{Boundary matrix factorization}
\begin{definition}[Boundary matrix decomposition]
Given a filtration $K_\bullet$ with $m$ simplices, let $\partial$ denote its $m \times m$ filtered boundary matrix. We call the factorization $R = \partial V$ the \emph{boundary matrix decomposition} of $\partial$ if:
 \begin{enumerate}[labelsep=3pt, topsep=3pt, itemsep=-0.10ex,parsep=1.2ex]
 	\item[I1.] $V$ is full-rank upper-triangular
 	\item[I2.] $R$ satisfies $\mathrm{low}_R[i] \neq \mathrm{low}_R[j]$ iff its $i$-th and $j$-th columns are nonzero
 	\end{enumerate} 
 	where $\mathrm{low}_R(i)$ denotes the row index of lowest non-zero entry of column $i$ in $R$ or $\mathrm{null}$ if it doesn't exist. Any matrix $R$ satisfying property (I2) is said to be  \emph{reduced}; that is, no two columns share the same low-row indices.
\end{definition}

% 
% Lipshitz statement about boundary matrix
% At the algebraic level, persistent homology admits a canonical decomposition for coefficients in any choice of field~\cite{}, though at the expense of torsion information.\footnote{}
% Given a strict total order $(V, <)$ on the vertices of $K$, define the ranking function $\varsigma_p(\tau) : K_p \to [m_p]$ which ranks the $p$-simplices of $K$ in a fixed way according to the order given by $<$. 
% If $\sigma$
%We begin by extending the standard definition of an elementary $p$-chain to the dynamic setting. Recall a $p$-chain of a simplicial filtration $K_\bullet$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}$ is a function $c_p$ on the oriented $p$-simplices of $K$ satisfying $c_p(\sigma) = -c_p(\sigma')$ if $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are opposite orientations of the same simplex, and $c_p(\sigma) = 0$ otherwise. 
%A $p$-chain is called \emph{elementary with respect to $q \in \mathbb{F}$} if it satisfies:
%\begin{align*}
%	c_p(\sigma) &= +q  \quad & \\
%	c_p(\sigma') &= -q \quad &\text{if } \sigma' \text{ is the opposite orientation of }\sigma \\
%	c_p(\tau) &= 0 \quad & \text{otherwise}
%\end{align*}
%Once all $p$-simplices of $K$ are oriented, each $p$-chain can be written unique as a finite linear combination $c_p = \sum_{i=0}^p n_i \sigma_i$ 
%of the corresponding elementary chains $\sigma_i$. 
%\begin{equation}
%	\partial_p(\sigma_i) = \partial_p[ v_0, \dots, v_p ] = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^p q(-1)^i [v_0, \dots, \hat{v_i}, \dots, v_p]
%\end{equation}
%where the notation $\hat{v}_p$ means that $v_p$ is excluded in the $i$-th summand, and $[v_0, \dots, v_p]$ denotes the oriented simplex. 
%\begin{definition}[Time-varying elementary $p$-chain]
%	An elementary $p$-chain $c_p : T \times K$ is said to be time-varying if $c_p(\cdot)(\sigma) = f(\sigma; t)$ is continuous in $T$. 
%\end{definition}
