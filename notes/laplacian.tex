%Thus we may solve this problem by solving $n$ sparse linear systems of that take the form $Ax = b$, where here $A$ is a Laplacian matrix with an $\epsilon \cdot I_n$ addition to it's diagonal. 
\subsection{Parameterized Laplacians}\label{sec:laplacian_theory2}
 For generality's sake, it is important to make the class of expressions for $\beta_p^\ast$ and $\mu_p^\ast$ as large as possible.
%elucidate the necessary conditions under which the spectral operators from section~\ref{sec:spectral_relax} are differentiable, so as to make the class of such operators as large as possible. 
%Towards this, we exploit another identity of the rank function applicable to zero-characteristic fields $\mathbb{F}$:
Since we are only concerned with homology over $\mathbb{R}$, we may exploit another identity of the rank function which is only applicable to zero characteristic fields: 
%$$\mathrm{rank}(\partial_p) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p \circ \partial_p^T) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^T \circ \partial_p)$$ 
$$\mathrm{rank}(X) = \mathrm{rank}(X X^T) = \mathrm{rank}(X^T X), \quad \text{for all } X \in \mathbb{F}^{n \times m}$$ 
% study of spectra of \emph{combinatorial Laplacians}
In the context of boundary operators, note that $\partial_1 \partial_1^T$ is the well known \emph{graph Laplacian}~\cite{chung1997spectral}, indicating we may express $\beta_0^\ast(\alpha)$ and $\mu_0^\ast(\alpha)$ using the ranks of Laplacian\footnote{By convention, we define $\partial_p = 0$ for all $p \leq 0$.} matrices.
%Indeed, as the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (or $X^T X$) are given by the squares of the singular values of $X$, we may study the singular values of boundary operators through the spectra of Laplacians.  

Following the seminal results from Horuk and Jost~\cite{horak2013spectra}, there are three natural ways to define ($p$-) Laplacian operators over a fixed simplicial complex $K$: the \emph{up}-Laplacian $L_p^{\text{up}}(K)$, the \emph{down}-Laplacian $L_p^{\text{dn}}(K)$, and their sum, which we refer to as the \emph{combinatorial} Laplacian $\Delta_p(K)$: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:comb_lap}
	\Delta_p = \underbrace{\partial_{p\+1} \circ \partial_{p\+1}^T}_{L_p^{\text{up}}} + \underbrace{\partial_{p}^T  \circ  \partial_{p}}_{L_p^{\text{dn}}} 
%	\simeq H() 
\end{equation}
\noindent 
All three operators $\Delta_p$, $L_p^{\text{up}}$, and $L_p^{\text{dn}}$ are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and compact~\cite{memoli2022persistent}---moreover, the \emph{non-zero} multisets $\Lambda(L_p^{\text{up}})$ and $\Lambda(L_{p+1}^{\text{dn}})$ are equivalent, implying they must have identical ranks (see Theorem 2.2 and 3.1 of~\cite{horak2013spectra}). 
%and thus have real, non-negative eigenvalues
Thus, for rank computations, it suffices to consider only one of them.
%Thus, from a rank-based perspective, any of these operators may be readily substituted for $\hat{\partial}_p^\ast$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:mu_betti_1}.

%moreover, as shown by~\cite{horak2013spectra}, their spectra are related by the identities $\Lambda(\Delta_p(K)) \doteq \Lambda(L_p^{\text{up}}) \, \cupdot \, \Lambda(L_p^{\text{dn}})$ and $\Lambda(L_p^{\text{up}}) \doteq \Lambda(L_{p+1})$,
%where $A \doteq B$ and $A \cupdot B$ denotes equivalence and union between the \emph{non-zero} elements of the multisets $A$ and $B$, respectively.
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:lap_spectra_conn}
%	\Lambda(\Delta_p(K)) \doteq \Lambda(L_p^{\text{up}}) \stackrel{\cdot}{\cup} \Lambda(L_p^{\text{dn}}), \quad \quad \Lambda(L_p^{\text{up}}) \doteq \Lambda(L_{p+1}^{\text{dn}})
%\end{equation}

Let $(K, f_\alpha)$ denote a parameterized family of filtrations of a simplicial complex $K$ equipped with a fixed but arbitrary linear extension $ \preceq$ of its face poset and fixed orientations $s(\sigma)$ inherited from the total order on the vertex set $(V, \preceq)$.
Without loss of generality, we define the weighted $p$ up-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_p \triangleq  L_p^{\mathrm{up}}$ at index $(a, b)$ as follows: 
%Let $\mathcal{L}_p^\ast$ denote any choice of $p$-Laplacian, which may generically of the forms given below: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:laplacian_decouple}
%\mathcal{L}_p^{\text{up}}(f) & \triangleq D_p^{1/2}(f) \cdot \partial_{p+1}(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p+1}(f) \cdot \partial_{p+1}^T(K_\preceq) \cdot D_p^{1/2}(f) 
\mathcal{L}_{p, \preceq}^{a,b}(\alpha) & \triangleq D_p(\bar{S}_a \circ f_\alpha) \cdot \partial_{p+1}(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p+1}(S_b \circ f_\alpha) \cdot \partial_{p+1}^T(K_\preceq) \cdot D_p(\bar{S}_a \circ f_\alpha) 
%\mathcal{L}_p^{\text{dn}}(\alpha) & \triangleq D_p^{1/2}(\alpha) \cdot \partial_p^T(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p+1}(\alpha) \cdot \partial_p(K_\preceq) \cdot D_p^{1/2}(\alpha) \\
%\Delta_p(\alpha) & \triangleq \mathcal{L}_p^{\text{up}}(\alpha) + \mathcal{L}_p^{\text{dn}}(\alpha) 
\end{align}
where $D_p(f)$ denotes a diagonal matrix whose entries represent the application of $f$ to the $p$-simplices of $K$.
As in~\eqref{eq:rank_equiv_param}, fixing step function $S_a$ and $\bar{S}_b$ at values $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ yields operators whose ranks correspond to the ranks of certain ``lower-left'' submatrices of the corresponding full boundary matrix $\partial$ of $(K, f)$. 
In particular, if $R = \partial V$ is the decomposition of $(K, f_\alpha)$ for some fixed choice of $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}$, then for any pair $(a,b)\in \Delta_+$ there exists indices $i = \sum_{\sigma \in K} (S_a \circ f_\alpha)(\sigma)$ and $j = \sum_{\sigma \in K} (S_b \circ f_\alpha)(\sigma)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{rank}(R_{p+1}^{i,j}) = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_{p+1}^{i, j}) = \mathrm{rank}(\hat{\partial}_{p+1}^{a,b}) = \mathrm{rank}\left((\hat{\partial}_{p+1}^{a,b})(\hat{\partial}_{p+1}^{a,b})^T \right) = \mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{L}_{p, \preceq}^{a,b})
\end{equation}
%\begin{align*}	
%	\mathrm{rank}(R_p^{i,j})& = \mathrm{rank}(\partial_p^{i, j})  \\
%	& = \mathrm{rank}(\hat{\partial}_p^{a,b}) = \mathrm{rank}(D_{p-1}(\bar{S}_a \circ f_\alpha) \cdot \partial_p(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p}(S_b \circ f_\alpha)) \\
%	& = \mathrm{rank}(\hat{\partial}_p^{a,b} (\hat{\partial}_p^{a,b})^T ) \\
%%	 & = \mathrm{rank}(D_{p-1}^{1/2}(\bar{S}_a \circ f_\alpha) \cdot \partial_{p+1}(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p}(S_b \circ f_\alpha) \cdot \partial_{p+1}^T(K_\preceq) \cdot D_{p-1}^{1/2}(\bar{S}_a \circ f_\alpha)) \\
%	 & = \mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{L}_{p-1}^{a,b}) \numberthis
%\end{align*}
where the second last equality uses the identity $\mathrm{rank}(X) = \mathrm{rank}(X^T X)$, which is true when $X \in \mathbb{F}^{n \times m}$ has coefficients in a zero-characteristic field $\mathbb{F}$. This confirms that we may substitute any of the parameterized boundary operators used in Proposition~\ref{prop:mu_betti_1}  with weighted Laplacian operators $\partial_{p+1}^\ast \mapsto \mathcal{L}_p^\ast$ equipped with the appropriate down- and up-step functions $S_\ast$ and $\bar{S}_\ast$, respectively.   

It is worth noting that composing step functions $\bar{S}_a, S_b : \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]$ with $f_\alpha$ is equivalent to endowing a \emph{weight function} $w: K \to (0, +\infty)$ on a subset $K_{a,b} \subseteq K$, in the sense described by~\cite{memoli2022persistent}.
In particular, if $w_p$ denotes the restriction of $w$ to $K^p$, 
%$w_p \triangleq \{ w(\sigma) \cdot \mathbb{1}(\mathrm{dim}(\sigma) = p) : \mathrm{}\}$, 
then $w_p$ defines an inner product $\langle \, \cdot, \cdot \,\rangle_{w_p}$ on space of $p$-chains $C_p(K, \mathbb{R})$ given by:
$$\langle [\sigma], [\sigma'] \rangle_{w_p} \triangleq \delta_{\sigma \sigma'} \cdot \big(w_p(\sigma)\big)^{-1}, \quad \forall \, \sigma, \sigma' \in K^p$$
where $\delta_{\sigma \sigma'} = \mathcal{1}(\sigma = \sigma')$ is the indicator function on $\sigma$. 
Moroever, this inner product $\langle [\sigma], [\sigma'] \rangle_{w_p}$ on $C_p(K, \mathbb{R})$ induces an inner product $\llangle \cdot, \cdot \rrangle$ on the cochain space $C^p(K, \mathbb{R}) \triangleq \mathrm{Hom}(C_p(K), \mathbb{R})$ given by:
$$ \llangle f, g \rrangle_{w_p} = \sum\limits_{\sigma \in K^p} w_p(\sigma) f([\sigma]) g([\sigma]), \quad \text{ for all } f,g \in C^p(K) $$ 
In these sense above,~\eqref{eq:laplacian_decouple} is simply choosing a particular inner product on the space of $p$-cochains. 

The insight provided by the inner product perspective is crucial for the validity of our method, as it is impart what allows use to generalize from simplicial boundary operators to $p$-th combinatorial Laplacians. 
%the understanding of the graph Laplacian to a broader framework
Indeed, the \emph{combinatorial Hodge Theorem} establishes the equivalence between~\eqref{eq:pers_homology} and  \eqref{eq:betti_four} in the case $a = b$, and is often attributed as the connection by which one extends the graph Laplacian to more general operators (i.e. for $p \geq 1$).
While these connections are invaluable to Exploration of these connections further falls beyond the scope of this work; we refer the interested reader to~\cite{memoli2022persistent} and references within for an overview.

\begin{remark}
One may interpret the action of sending a subset $S \subseteq K$ of $p$-simplices to $0$ as a restriction of $K$ to a sub-complex $L = K \setminus S$, which suggests e.g.~\eqref{eq:pbn} and~\eqref{eq:laplacian_decouple} could be alternatively defined using the inclusion maps $L \hookrightarrow K$ between \emph{simplicial pairs} $(L, K)$, as in~\cite{memoli2022persistent}.

%However, our parameterized definition of a boundary operator~\eqref{eq:param_boundary_matrix} may not always correspond to a subcomplex in the sense that if two distinct $p$-simplices $\tau, \tau' \in K^p, \tau \neq \tau'$ sharing a coface $\sigma \in K^{p+1}$, we allow the situation where $f(\tau) > 0$ and $f(\sigma) > 0$ but $f(\tau') = 0$ (due to the arbitrary choice of $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$). 
\end{remark}

%Unlike $\partial_p(\alpha)$, the set $\{ \, \hat{L}_p^{\mathrm{up}}(\alpha) : \alpha \in \mathcal{A} \, \}$ lies strictly within $\mathbb{S}^n_+$, implying $\lVert \Phi(\hat{L}_p^{\mathrm{up}})(\alpha) \rVert_\ast$ is continuously differentiable. 
%Moreover, Laplacian operators are known to encode rich geometric information in their spectra~\cite{horak2013spectra}, suggesting this geometric structure may now be used in a persistence setting. We give exemplary applications exploiting both facts in section~\ref{sec:applications}. 

% Maybe not relevent anymore
% We now describe an $\mathcal{A}$-parameterized variation of $L_p^{\mathrm{up}}$. Following~\cite{}, we write $X^+$ to denote the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and for brevity write $X^{+/2} = (X^{+})^{1/2}$. Using the decoupling observation from~\eqref{eq:decouple}, observe we may write the inner operator from~\cite{} as follows:
%$$ \hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}(\alpha) = D_p^{+/2}(f_\alpha) \circ \partial_p(K_{\preceq^\ast}) \circ D_{p+1}(f_\alpha) \circ \partial_p(K_{\preceq^\ast})^T \circ D_p^{+/2}(f_\alpha) $$ 
%Like $\partial_p(\alpha)$, the entries of $\hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}(\alpha)$ vary continuously in $\alpha$ and may be thresholded using step (or smoothstep) functions to yield any the constitutive terms from proposition~\ref{prop:mu_betti_1}. 
%Algebraically, 
%$\mathcal{L}_{a,b}(\cdot, \alpha) : C^p(K_b, K_a; \mathbb{R}) \to C^p(K_b, K_a; \mathbb{R})$
 
%Let $K$ denote a simplicial complex and parameters $(p, \epsilon, \omega)$ satisfying $p \geq 0$, $\epsilon > 0$, and $\omega > 0$, respectively, define the $\mathcal{A}$-parameterized  \emph{spectral multiplicity} of $R$ as:
%	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mu_cont_lap}
%	\hat{\mu}_{p,\epsilon}^R(\alpha) = 
%		 \lVert \Phi_{p\+1}^{j \+ \delta, k}) \rVert_\ast - 
%		 \lVert \Phi_\epsilon^\alpha(\hat{\partial}_{p\+1}^{i \+ \delta, k}) \rVert_\ast -  
%		 \lVert \Phi_\epsilon^\alpha(\hat{\partial}_{p\+1}^{j \+ \delta, l}) \rVert_\ast + 
%		 \lVert \Phi_\epsilon^\alpha(\hat{\partial}_{p\+1}^{i \+ \delta, l}) \rVert_\ast \numberthis
%	\end{equation}


%Note that, as with the other operators mentioned, the nullity is not affected by this normalization---the rank function is invariant under scalar products with identical sign.   

%Thus, we may retain the inner product interpretation from~\eqref{} while working with PSD operators---
%One shortcoming of the stability result shown above is that the Lipshitz constant depends explicitly on the magnitude of $f_\alpha$, which in-turn affects the stability of the proposed relaxation if $f_\alpha$ is scaled poorly, i.e. $\lambda \cdot f_\alpha$. 
%Moreover, the continuous differentiability of $\lVert \Phi_\epsilon(\cdot) \rVert_\ast$ only extends to linear operators defined over the positive semi-definite cone, and the explicit form of the differential $\partial \lVert \Phi_\epsilon(\cdot) \rVert_\ast$ depends on the domain of its corresponding spectral function $\phi(\cdot)$ being bounded to some interval $(a,b)$~\cite{bhatia2013matrix}.  
%
%Consider the $\mathcal{H}$-parameterized boundary matrix from Definition~\eqref{def:time_boundary_matrix}. Assume that the filter function $f : K \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is strictly positive. By taking the product $(\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j})(\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j})^T$ for some choice of $h \in \mathcal{H}$, we have:
%\begin{align*}\label{eq:param_up_lap}
%	\hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}(K, f) &= (\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j})(\hat{\partial}_p^{i,j})^T \\
%	&= (V_p^i)^{+} \circ \partial_p \circ (W_{p+1}^j)^2 \circ \partial_p^T \circ (V_p^i)^{+} \\
%	&\propto (V_p^i)^{+/2} \circ \partial_p \circ W_{p+1}^j \circ \partial_p^T \circ (V_p^i)^{+/2}  \numberthis
%\end{align*}
%where $A^{+/2} = (A^{1/2})^+$. 

%A second difficulty that arises with both the symmetric and asymmetric forms of~\eqref{eq:l_up} is the problem of unbounded spectra. It is not difficult to see that the inverse terms in~\eqref{eq:l_up} drive $\lVert L_p^{\textrm{up}}\rVert_2$ upwards indefinitely as $f(\sigma) \to 0^{+}$. 

%By choosing the weights, one effectively determines the corresponding inner product, which in-turn determines the spectral range of the corresponding operator.
%We expect the spectra of $\hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}$ to obey many of the properties enjoyed by $L_p^{\text{up}}$ and its variants. 
%Indeed, though the spectrum of $\hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}$ is unbounded for general choices of $f$, we show that the normalized up-Laplacian given by:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:param_normalized_up_lap}
%	 \hat{\mathcal{L}}_p^{\text{up}}(K, f) = \mathcal{D}_p(\mathcal{S}_i \circ f_\alpha)^{+/2} \circ \partial_p \circ W_{p+1}(\mathcal{S}_j \circ f_\alpha) \circ \partial_p^T \circ (\mathcal{D}_p^i)^{+/2} 
%\end{equation}
%has its spectrum bounded in the interval $[0, p+2]$, where $\tilde{D}_p^i$ corresponds to the weighted degree matrix with entries $\{ \mathrm{deg}_w(\sigma) \}$. We defer discussion of the exact forms of these matrices, including the computational details the matrix-vector product $x \mapsto \hat{L}_p^{\text{up}}$, to section~\eqref{sec:comb_lap}. 



%\begin{remark}
%~\cite{} studied a persistent version of the~\eqref{}, a \emph{persistent laplacian}, whose nullity yields the persistent Betti number. Additionally, satisfies many attractive qualities one would want out of a laplacian, including multiplicity of its 0th eigenvalue, disjoint spectra of disjoint components, and connections to notions of effective resistance. 
%Thus, one would hope there to be a $p$-th persistent version of equation~\eqref{eq:laplace_hom} whose form is akin to ~\eqref{}, however as~\cite{} showed, the matrix representation. 
%\end{remark}

%In this effort, we consider a very general kind of combinatorial Laplacian. GHere, we define the combinatorial $p$-th weighted up-Laplacian of the triple $(w_{p}^l, w_{p+1}, w_{p}^r)$ by: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:weighted_up_laplace}
%	L_p^{\mathrm{up}}(K) := W_p^l \circ \partial_{p+1} \circ W_{p+1} \circ \partial_{p+1}^T \circ W_p^r
%\end{equation} 
%where $W_p^\ast = \mathrm{diag}(\{ w_i \})$ is a diagonal weight matrix whose corresponding weights are given by the appropriate function of $(w_{p}^l, w_{p+1}, w_{p}^r)$, respectively. 
%Setting all weight functions to the identity yields the combinatorial Laplacian~\cite{}. 
%When $p = 0$ and $K = (V,E)$ is a graph, setting the diagonal entries of $W_1$ to edge weights and $W_0^l = W_0^r = I$ yields Kirchoff's \emph{weighted graph Laplacian}. 
%Alternatively, setting $W_0^l[i,i] = 1/\mathrm{deg}(v_i)$ and $W_0^r = I$ yields the \emph{normalized graph Laplacian} studied by Chung~\cite{}.
%Setting $W_p^l[i,i] = w_{p}^l(\sigma_i)^{-1}$ for all $\sigma \in K^p$ and $W_p^r = I$ yields the \emph{up Laplacian} from~\cite{}.
%\begin{align*}\label{eq:up_laplace_2}
%	\tilde{L}_p^{\mathrm{up}} &= \partial_{p+1} W_{p+1} \partial_{p+1}^T W_p^{-1}  \\
%	&= W_p^{1/2} \left ( W_p^{-1/2}  \partial_{p+1} W_{p+1} \partial_{p+1}^T   W_p^{-\frac{1}{2}} \right ) W_p^{-\frac{1}{2}} \numberthis
%\end{align*}
%Note that $\tilde{L}_p^{\mathrm{up}}$ is not be symmetric matrix in general. However, like the vertex-weighted graph laplacian from~\cite{}, the expression from~\eqref{eq:up_laplace_2} is of the form $W^{-1} P W$ where $P$ is symmetric positive semi-definite and $W$ is a positive diagonal matrix.

%\begin{document} \vspace{-2em} \maketitle \vspace{-1em}
%Let $G = (V, E)$ denote a graph with vertex set $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and edge set $E \subseteq V \times V$. A weighted graph is a pair $(G, \mu)$ where $\mu: V \times V \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is an weight function satisfying $\mu_{v,v'} = \mu_{v', v}$, $\mu_{v,v'} > 0$ iff $(v,v') \in E$. Note that the last condition implies $\mu$ completely characterizes the connectivity of $G$, i.e. positive values of $\mu$ indicate the presence of edges. 
%
%We recall the Spectral Theorem, which characterizes the eiegnvlaues of a linear operator in terms of \emph{Rayleigh quotients}. If $U$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $A$ a linear operator on $U$, then for any non-zero $u \in U$, the Rayleigh quotient of $u$ is defined as: 
%$$ \mathcal{R}(u) = \frac{\langle Au, u \rangle}{\langle u, u\rangle}$$
%
%Any Laplacian operator $\mathcal{L} = A - D$ has a spectrum of $\lambda \in [0,2]$ for any $\lambda \in \Lambda(L)$.
%
%Let $(\lambda, f)$ denote a eigenvalue/eigenfunction pair of $L$, respectively. 
%$$\langle L f, f \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{v \in V} \sum\limits_{v' \in V} \mu(v,v') \cdot \left(f(v) - f(v')\right)^2$$

%
%% From: Eigenvalues of the Laplacian on inhomogeneous membranes
%One can interpret the eigenvalues of the Laplacian physically as the frequencies of vibration of a membrane, as energy levels of a Hamiltonian in an infinite potential well, as rates of decay for the heat (or mass diffusion) equation, and as cut-off frequencies for waveguides.
%
%Two Laplacians $L_1$ and $L_2$ are cospectral if and only if $\alpha L_1 + \beta I + \gamma J$ and $\alpha L_2 + \beta I + \gamma J$ are (where $\alpha \neq 0$). 
%
%% Which graphs are determined by their spectrum?
%The following can be deduced from the spectrum of the adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix of $G$: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item The number of vertices
%	\item Number of edges
%	\item Whether $G$ is a regular 
%	\item Whether $G$ is regular with any fixed girth 
%\end{enumerate}
%Additional, the spectrum of the Laplacian contains information about 1. the number of connected components and 2. the number of unique spanning trees. The former is given by the algebraic multiplicity of the $0$ eigenvalue of $L$ (the corank of $L$), and the latter is given by---if $G$ is connected---$1/n$ times the product of $L$ non-zero eigenvalues. 
%
%There are many graphs which are determined by their spectrum (DS).
