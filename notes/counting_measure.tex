%measures the pseudo-distance~\cite{cerri2013betti} between points
%---if $X$ is a triangulable space and $f,g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ are two continuous functions, then $d(\beta_f, \beta_g) \leq \max\limits_{x \in X} \, \lvert f(x) - g(x) \rvert$, where:
%\begin{equation*}\label{eq:pbn_stability}
%	d(\beta_f, \beta_g) = \inf\limits_{\phi} \; \sup\limits_{p \in \mathrm{dgm}(f)} \lVert p - \phi(p) \rVert_{\widetilde{\infty} }
%\end{equation*}
%is the (extended) matching distance between PBN functions ($\beta_f$, $\beta_g$), $\phi$ ranges over all multi-bijections between $\mathrm{dgm}(f)$ and $\mathrm{dgm}(g)$, and $\lVert \,\cdot \, \rVert_{\widetilde{\infty}}$ measures the pseudo-distance~\cite{cerri2013betti} between points.
%Thus, PBN functions are stable functions: small changes in continuous scalar-valued filtering functions imply small changes in the corresponding persistent Betti numbers functions. 


% This was the first output-sensitive algorithm. 
%we generalize this In the spirit of~\eqref{eq:measure}, 

%Despite the duality between diagrams and PBNs, most practitioners work directly with former, not the latter. Indeed, though betti numbers have a certain computational advantages and are stable in the sense of~\eqref{eq:pbn_stability}, a number of barriers prevent their use in real-world settings. 
%For instance, the main stability theorem from~\cite{cohen2005stability} assumes that the underlying filtering function or persistence module is \emph{tame} and are defined over a triangulable space. Including this assumption guarantees the number of corner points will be finite and then ~\eqref{eq:pbn_stability} reduces to the bottleneck distance from~\cite{cohen2005stability}. In contrast, relaxing the assumption that such that  $f$ just continuous (as in equation~\eqref{eq:pbn_cont}) implies the number of corner points may be countably infinite, eliminating any hope of recovering the diagram from a finite set of multiplicity computations. 
%Moreover, although the matching distance between PBN functions $\beta_p(f), \, \beta_p(g)$ is appealing from both a theoretical and practical perspective due to its stability, computing the optimal matching distance requires both knowledge of the diagrams $\mathrm{dgm}_p(f), \, \mathrm{dgm}_p(g)$ themselves and the optimal bijections between them. 

%% Moreover, achieving the infimum in ... requires computing the optimal bijection ... between D(f), D(g), which takes O(...). 
%%one arrives at definitions of PBNs in the flavor of equation~\eqref{pbn_cont}.
